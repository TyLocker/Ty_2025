Hello!ðŸ‘‹My name is Ty Locker and here are a few things about me. I play football here at Del Norte. Some things very important to me are my family and friends. Things I do in my free time are fish, lift weights, and play videogames. The subject I am best at is math and the one I am worst at is english. I am a middle child of 2 brothers and something we all do together is fish. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d45af6f7-699c-42ac-a77b-85989f8f8cc7)
